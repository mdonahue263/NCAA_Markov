"# NCAA_Markov" 

Roadmap
Find data endpoint for play-by-play and roster

Write functions to pull and process those data

Create very small markov model on one game without player data, just time and scores

run simulation of game with that model

add starting player data and repeat

pull multiple games in the order of 10-100 and train the model on that

create matchup that did not exist in training data and simulate that

write functions to process the possibility of player substitutions
